            <p>It's important to me that you're happy. Here's something that's fun. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. At home you have unlimited time.</p>

            <p>There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Let's do that again. And just raise cain.</p>

            <p>You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Only eight colors that you need. In your world you have total and absolute power. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.</p>

            <p>Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Anyone can paint. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.</p>
